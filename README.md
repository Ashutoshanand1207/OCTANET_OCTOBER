Web development projects made for OCTANET internship

First Task [Landing Page](https://ashutoshanand1207.github.io/OCTANET_OCTOBER/landing-page/)

 A landing page is an ideal web development project for beginners. It requires basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Through this project, I learned to create columns, divide sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. The most important aspect is unleashing my creativity to design an impressive page. Paid attention to alignments, padding, color palette, boxes, and other elements. Be mindful of CSS to avoid overlapping elements. In short, a landing page project allowed me to apply HTML and CSS skills, encouraging my creativity while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
